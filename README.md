# Theater Front-End

Welcome to the front-end part of the Theater project! This application is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for managing and viewing theater-related data.

## Technologies Used

- **Angular**: A powerful JavaScript framework used for building dynamic single-page applications (SPAs). It offers a robust structure for our app's architecture.
- **Angular Material**: A UI component library for Angular, providing a range of pre-built, high-quality components that adhere to the Material Design guidelines.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that provides static typing, making the development process more predictable and easier to debug.
- **RxJS**: A library for reactive programming using Observables, used for managing asynchronous data streams and event-based programming.
- **Sass**: A preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into CSS, enhancing the styling capabilities with features like variables, nested rules, and mixins.

## Features

- **Routing and Navigation**: Utilizes Angular's router module for navigating between different views.
- **State Management**: Implemented using services and RxJS to manage state across the application, ensuring data consistency and efficient communication between components.
- **Form Handling**: Angular's reactive forms are used for handling user input, providing a powerful and flexible way to manage form state and validation.
- **API Integration**: The app integrates with a backend API to fetch and manage data, using Angular's HTTPClient for making HTTP requests.
